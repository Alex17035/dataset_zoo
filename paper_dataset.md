# 论文实验中的数据集.

每篇论文实验中所用到的数据集对这篇文章很重要, 说明作者有信心该论文的模型适合这个数据集，或者说 能证明模型的可能只是在这个数据集上. 但是对于使用者来说，可以更具数据集的相似性和差异去使用不同的模型，虽然有些解释可能并不准确.

> Convolutional Neural Networks for Sentence Classificatio

- **MR:** Movie reviews with one sentence per re- view. Classification involves detecting posi- tive/negative reviews (Pang and Lee, 2005)

- **SST-1:** Stanford Sentiment Treebank—an extension of MR but with train/dev/test splits provided and fine-grained labels (very pos- itive, positive, neutral, negative, very nega- tive), re-labeled by Socher et al. (2013).

- **SST-2:** Same as SST-1 but with neutral re- views removed and binary labels.

- **Subj:** Subjectivity dataset where the task is to classify a sentence as being subjective or objective (Pang and Lee, 2004)

- **TREC:** TREC question dataset—task in- volves classifying a question into 6 question types (whether the question is about person, location, numeric information, etc.) (Li and Roth, 2002)

- **CR:** Customer reviews of various products (cameras, MP3s etc.). Task is to predict pos- itive/negative reviews (Hu and Liu, 2004).
